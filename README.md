## Fabr

Fabr is a build orchestration tool designed to provide fast, accurate builds, even in complex scenarios
involving multiple languages, cross-compilation, and multi-pass builds.

The core principles underlying fabr are

- A simple yet powerful dataflow-based language for specifying targets and dependencies
- Pervasive filesystem virtualization, including sandboxing of executable processes.
- Strict separation of target definition (sources and dependencies) from rules and configuration.

Note: The current implementation is completely experimental. It currently is completely non-functional,
and the language itself is subject to wholesale revision.
